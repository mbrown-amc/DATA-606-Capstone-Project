# DATA 606 Capstone

Using ML to study fantasy football points and its relationship to overall team success (wins/loss percentage)

## Description

Using 50 NFL seasons worth of fantasy football points and yearly team standings, we aim to answer:
Do teams with players who accumulate a lot of fantasy points achieve more wins than teams that do not?
Is there a correlation between fantasy points scored and team wins? 
Does a particular player position have a stronger correlation to wins?

We will use historical data to train a model that predicts team wins based on fantasy points
and compare projected 2020 team win results to actual results
